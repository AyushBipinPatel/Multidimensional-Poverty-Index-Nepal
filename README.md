# Multidimensional-Poverty-Index-Nepal
This repository is an attempt to record the process of creating a Multidimensional Poverty Index for Nepal by using the MICS data for the year 2014. 

I will be using R to create the MPI. The R code will be the equivalent of the STATA code provided by OPHI.

One can "cross-check their results with the results published excel table for the 2017 global MPI: https://ophi.org.uk/2017-summer-global-mpi-resources/ "
